# Wearable-Gas-Leak-Alert-Device
Developed a product for the auditorily impaired to alert them of gas leaks via wearable personal device with wrist mounted vibrator. This code works in conjuction with a wearable watch and micro computer to activate a vibrator if dangerous amounts of carbon monoxide is detected. As the level of carbon monoxide exceeds increasily greater thresholds, the frequency of vibrations increases. A live feed of carbon monoxide levels is also outputted to an LCD screen on the wearable watch. Once the user has gotten to safety, the program can be terminated with a button, at which point a text file is created containing a log of carbon monoxide levels that the user was exposed to that can be forwarded to the fire department or health professionals for analysis. 

The program is intended to be used with a raspberry pi and was tested using a raspberry pi emulator. The final code can be found in Team41_DP3_Python_Program.py
